## Usage 

In this challenge, we appplied what we learned using GitHub, HTML and CSS to create a live version of the Horiseon website. A main component of the assignment included how to apply CSS classes to create unique class attributes. By setting up the local and GitHub repo, I was able to add updates, commit changes, and launch my branch successfully. Applied article, section and aside class ids to specify and clean up section content. Specifically, the article ids are used here in order to jump down the page using the Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing list items located next to h1 Horiseon.
